* DONE [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/BOLT][World Record]]
This news headline has been echoing in Chef's mind since 20092009 when
he started his career in sprinting. This time in the 20212021 Tokyo
Olympics he is determined to make a new world record. There are mainly
33 important factors that result in the variation in speed during
practice and during competition.

  -The first factor is a difference in track material which results in
  variation in the speed at competition with respect to practice by
  a factor of k1k1.

  -The second factor is wind speed which results in variation in the
  speed at competition with respect to practice by a factor of k2k2.

  -The final factor is the maximum speed achieved during practice. If
  the maximum speed during practice is vv m/s then in competition it
  will be k3∗vk3∗v m/s.

  -Given Chef's max speed vv during practice and the factors 
  k1,k2,k3k1,k2,k3, find whether he will be able to create a new world
  record, i.e, can he complete 100100 m in less than 9.589.58 seconds?

Note: The final time displayed by the Olympics clock is showing after
 rounding the original time to 22 places of decimal and is the only
 measure of runners performance.

** Input:
First line will contain TT, number of testcases. 
Then the testcases follow.Each testcase contains of a single
line of input, four floats k1,k2,k3,vk1,k2,k3,v.

* TODO [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/SDICE][Chef and dice]]
Chef has NN 6-sided standard dice. Each die has dimensions 1×1×1. 
Since Chef is bored during the quarantine, he decides to stack dice
 for fun.

First, Chef forms four vertical stacks of dice (not necessarily with
the same height; empty stacks are allowed) on his table, which together
make up a pile of dice with base area up to 2×22×2. Among all
such structures, the total visible surface area of Chef's structure
 must be the smallest possible.

Then, Chef calculates the number of pips on the visible faces of all
 dice in the structure. A face of a die is visible if it does not 
touch the table or another die.

Now, he is wondering: among all possible arrangements of dice, 
what is the maximum possible total number of visible pips? Since he
is busy cooking, he is asking you to solve this.
** Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting 
the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

** Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one 
integer ― the maximum possible number of visible pips.

* DONE [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/KAVGMAT][Worthy Matrix]]
Chef found a matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns
 (numbered 1 through M), where for each row r and column c, the cell
 in row r and column c (denoted by(r,c)) contains an integer Ar,c.

This matrix has two interesting properties:
   -The integers in each row form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for
   each valid i, Ai,1≤Ai,2≤…≤Ai,M.

   -The integers in each column also form a non-decreasing sequence, 
   i.e. for each valid j, A1,j≤A2,j≤…≤AN,j.

A KK-worthy submatrix is a square submatrix of AA,i.e. a submatrix with
l rows and l columns, for any integer ll, such that the average of all
the integers in this submatrix is ≥K.

Chef wants you to find the number of K-worthy submatrices of A.

** Input
   -The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting
   the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

   -The first line of each test case contains three space-separated
   integers N, M and K.

   -N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains
   MM space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,Ai,3,…,Ai,M.
** Output
   For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― 
   the number of KK-worthy submatrices of AA.

You are given a binary string SS. Chef defines MEX(S) as the smallest
non-negative integer such that its binary representation (without 
leading '0'-s; in particular, the binary representation of 00 is "0") 
is not a subsequence of SS.

Chef is asking you to find MEX(S)MEX(S). Since this integer could be
very large, find its binary representation (without leading '0'-s).

** Input
  -The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the
  number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
  -The first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.

* TODO [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/TREEPERM][Tree Permutations]]
You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N), rooted at
node 1. For each valid i, node i has a value aiai written on it.

An undirected simple path between any two nodes u and v is said to be
vertical if u=v or u is an ancestor of v or v is an ancestor of u. 
Let's define a vertical partition of the tree as a set of vertical
paths such that each node belongs to exactly one of these paths.

You are also given a sequence of NN integers b1,b2,…,bN. A vertical
partition is good if, for each of its paths, we can permute the values 
written on the nodes in this path, and this can be done in such a way 
that we reach a state where for each valid ii, the value written on
node i is bi.

The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter S. If S=1, your
task is only to determine whether at least one good vertical partition 
exists. If S=2, you are required to find the number of good vertical
partitions modulo 1,000,000,007 ((10^9)+7).

** Input
   -The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the
   number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.

   -The first line of each test case contains two space-separated
   integers NN and SS.
   
   -Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated
   integers uu and vv denoting that nodes uu and vv are connected by 
   an edge.

   -The next line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN

   -The line after that contains NN space-separated integers b1,b2,…,bN
** Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer:

   -If S=1S=1, this integer should be 11 if a good vertical partition
   exists or 00 if it does not exist.
   
   -If S=2S=2, this integer should be the number of good
   vertical partitions modulo 1,000,000,007 ((10^9)+7).

* TODO [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/PAIRFLIP][Chef and Pair Flips]]
Chef has two matrices A and B, each with size N×M. Each cell of the
matrix AA contains a character '0' or '1', while each cell of the 
matrix BB contains '?', '0' or '1'.

The matrix A can be modified using zero or more operations. In one
operation, Chef can choose two cells in the matrix A which lie either
in the same row or in the same column and flip the characters in each
 of these cells (flipping means changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').

Chef wants the matrix A to match the matrix B. Formally, for each row r
 and column c, if the cell in row r and column c of B contains '0' or
 '1', then he wants the cell in row rr and column c of A to contain 
the same character; otherwise (for cells containing '?'), it may 
contain either '0' or '1'.

The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter EE. If E=0, you
should only find the smallest number of operations required to achieve
 this goal. If E=1, you should also find one sequence of operations with
 the smallest length which achieves it.

** Input
   -The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the
   number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.

   -The first line of each test case contains three space-separated
   integers N, M and E.

   -NN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains
   a single string Ai with length M describing the i-th row of the
   matrix A.

   -NN more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines
   contains a single string Bi with length M describing the i-th 
   row of the matrix B.
** Output
For each test case:

   -If it is not possible to make A match B, print a single line
   containing the integer -1.

   -Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer K ― the 
   smallest required number of operations.

   -Then, if E=1, print K lines describing the sequence of operations
   you want to perform. An operation should be printed in one of the
   following formats:

      -R r i j to flip the characters in cells in row r and columns i
      and j (1≤r≤N, 1≤i,j≤M)

      -C c i j to flip the characters in cells in column cc and rows i
      and j (1≤c≤M, 1≤i,j≤N)

      -If there are several possible answers, you may find any one of
      them.
* TODO [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/CHAOSEMP][Destroy the EMP Chip]]
This is an interactive problem.

A mysterious organisation has stolen an EMP chip prototype from a
high-tech US facility. IGI knows the consequences of the chip falling
into the wrong hands. Since it is just a prototype, they wish to
destroy it completely instead of attempting to retrieve it. 
The best opportunity to do so is when the chip is being transferred 
from one base to another in a secured truck.

The truck can move on an infinite two-dimensional plane. Initially, it
is located at some point with integer coordinates (H,K). Unfortunately,
this point and the route the truck is going to follow are unknown.

To accomplish his task, David Jones can use two kinds of weapons with
the following feedback systems:

   1. Hellfire ― Launched towards a single point(X,Y). Anything lying
   at this point is instantly destroyed. Let's denote the location of
   the truck at this point in time by (A,B)(A,B). Then, the feedback
   is one of the following strings:

      "O" if X=A and Y=B
      "PY" if X>A and Y=B
      "NY" if X<A and Y=B
      "XP" if X=A and Y>B
      "XN" if X=A and Y<B
      "PP" if X>A and Y>B
      "PN" if X>A and Y<B
      "NP" if X<A and Y>B
      "NN" if X<A and Y<B
   2. Ring of Fire ― Applied on a rectangular region with a bottom left
   corner (X1,Y1) and a top right corner (X2,Y2). Anything lying on
   the perimeter of the rectangle gets instantly destroyed. Let's
   denote the location of the truck at this point in time by(A,B). 
   Then, the feedback is one of the following strings:

      "O" if (A,B)(A,B) lies on the perimeter of the rectangle
      "IN" if (A,B)(A,B) lies strictly inside the rectangle
      "OUT" if (A,B)(A,B) lies outside the rectangle

   In addition, if an attack is unsuccessful, the truck moves exactly 
   D units in one of the four possible axis-parallel directions, i.e. 
   it moves from its current position (A,B) to (A+D,B) or (A,B+D) or 
   (A−D,B) or (A,B−D) (not necessarily the same direction for all
   unsuccessful attacks). The value of DD is fixed and known to be
   either 00 (the truck does not move) or 11.

   Each weapon may be used multiple times and they may be used in any
   order. However, since using the weapons is costly, you may only make
   up to QQ attacks (with both types of weapons in total). Obviously, 
   your task is to destroy the truck, i.e. to receive "O" as the
   feedback.

** Interaction
First, you should read a line containing three space-separated 
integers T, Q and D. You should solve T test cases, each with the same
 parameters QQ and DD. The description of interaction for TT test cases
 follows.

For each test case, you may make up to QQ queries. For each query:
   -If you want to use a Hellfire attack, print a single line
   containing three space-separated integers 11, 
   X and Y (−2⋅1018≤X,Y≤2⋅10^18)
   
   -If you want to use a Ring of Fire attack, print a single line
   containing five space-separated integers 22, X1, Y1, X2 and Y2 
   (−2⋅1018≤X1≤X2≤2⋅10^18 and −2⋅1018≤Y1≤Y2≤2⋅10^18).
   
   -Then, you should read a single line containing one string. If you
   ask an invalid query or exceed the query limit, this string is 
   "FAILED" and you should immediately terminate your program to 
   receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, this string is the
   feedback for your attack.

As soon as you receive feedback "O", you should stop making queries and
continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note: Some of the test files use a non-adaptive grader, while some use
an adaptive grader, where the initial point and the route are not
fixed at the start, but the answers to your queries are chosen in such
 a way that there is always at least one initial point (H,K)(H,K) and
 sequence of moves which are consistent with all answers.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

* TODO [[https://www.codechef.com/APRIL21C/problems/WTRSORT][Water Sort Puzzle]]
Chef wants to study reactions between non-miscible reagent samples with
different colours. There are NN colours (numbered 11 through NN). Chef
has N+2 test tubes (numbered 11 through N+2), each of them can hold
a volume MM ml; initially, tubes N+1 and N+2 are empty, while
 for each ii (1≤i≤N), the i-th tube is completely filled and contains 
M ml of reagents with some colours. Since reagents with different colours
do not mix, we can describe the contents of the i-th tube from its
bottom to its top by a sequence Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,M, i.e. for each valid
j, the j-th mililiter of volume of the i-th tube, measured from the
bottom, is filled by a reagent with a colour Bi,j. The total initial
volume of each reagent is equal to M ml.

To facilitate his study, Chef wants to redistribute the reagents into
tubes according to their colours, i.e. at the end, for each colour i,
there must be exactly one tube which contains all MM ml of this reagent
and no reagents with other colours. The specific positions of reagents
or empty tubes in this final state do not matter.

In order to achieve this, you may first reverse the order of reagents 
in some (possibly none or all) tubes. Then, you may perform operations
 of two types:

   1. Choose two test tubes P and Q and transfer the topmost 1 ml of
   reagent from the tube PP to the top of the tube Q.

      -This is only allowed if PP is non-empty and QQ is not full.

      -If QQ is empty, the cost of this operation is 00.

      -Otherwise, let's denote the colour of the topmost reagent in 
      tube P by U and the colour of the topmost reagent in Q (before
      this operation) by V. If DU,V=-1, this operation is not allowed.
      Otherwise, it is allowed and its cost is DU,V.

   2.Choose a test tube P and increase its capacity by 11 ml. The cost
   of this operation is CP.

You are given the costs of pouring reagents on top of each other and 
information about which reagents react with each other and therefore
cannot be poured on top of each other, i.e. the matrix DD. It is
guaranteed that Di,j=Dj,i for each valid i and j and Di,i=0 for each
valid i.

You must separate the reagents (reach the state described above) using
no more than 220=1,048,576 operations. The sum of costs of the
operations you use to achieve this should be as small as possible.

** Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N
and M.
The second line contains N+2 space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN+2.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains N 
space-separated integers Di,1,Di,2,…,Di,N.
N more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,M.
** Output
First, print a single line containing two space-separated integers X 
and Y (0≤X≤N, 0≤Y≤220) ― the number of test tubes whose contents you 
wish to initially reverse and the number of operations you wish to 
perform.

Then, print a single line containing X space-separated integers A1,A2,…,Ax ― 
the numbers of the test tubes you wish to initially reverse (1≤Ai≤N 
for each valid i).

Then, print Y lines describing the operations in the order in which you
wish to perform them.

To perform an operation of the first type, print a line containing 
three space-separated integers 1, P and Q (1≤P,Q≤N+2, P≠Q).

To perform an operation of the second type, print a line containing two
space-separated integers 2 and P (1≤P≤N+2).
